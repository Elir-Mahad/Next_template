# Next template

1. Styled components
2. Dark mode and light mode themes
3. Footer at the bottom regardless of content length

Important notes:
- After installing the next app, create the .gitignore file 
  - When you run the app with 'yarn run dev' a .next folder gets created
  - This folder and the node_modules should not be pushed to github.
  - Referencing them in the gitignore file will stop them from being pushed.
  - This will ensure that they only changes you see in your commits are your changes.
